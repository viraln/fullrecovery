## Brain Implant Surgery: What to Expect

Brain implant surgery is a complex and highly specialized procedure that typically involves the following steps:

**Step 1:** **Pre-operative Assessment:** Thorough neurological and psychological evaluations are conducted to determine candidacy and identify potential risks. This includes detailed brain imaging (MRI, CT scans) to map out the surgical target.
**Step 2:** **Anesthesia:** The patient is placed under general anesthesia to ensure they are comfortable and pain-free during the procedure.
**Step 3:** **Craniotomy:** A small opening is created in the skull to access the brain. The size and location of the opening depend on the specific type of implant and the target brain region.
**Step 4:** **Implant Placement:** The implant is carefully inserted into the targeted brain region using stereotactic guidance, which involves precise mapping of the brain's coordinates.
**Step 5:** **Closure:** The opening in the skull is closed, and the scalp is sutured. The external components of the implant, such as the battery pack or controller, are typically placed under the skin in the chest or abdomen.
**Step 6:** **Post-operative Monitoring:** The patient is closely monitored in the hospital for several days to assess their recovery and identify any potential complications.

The recovery period can vary depending on the individual and the type of implant, but it typically involves several weeks of rest and rehabilitation.
