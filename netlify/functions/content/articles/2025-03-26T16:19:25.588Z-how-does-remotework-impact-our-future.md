The year is 2025.  The once-revolutionary concept of "remote work" is no longer a novelty; it's the bedrock of a fundamentally altered global economy and societal landscape.  This isn't just about working from home; it's a seismic shift impacting everything from urban planning and economic inequality to our mental health and the very fabric of our working lives.
