## 1. Understanding the Foundations: What is Web3?

At its core, Web3 is a decentralized internet built on blockchain technology. To understand the significance of this shift, let's briefly recap the previous iterations of the web:

*   **Web1 (roughly 1990-2004):** The "read-only" web. Static pages, limited interaction, and primarily controlled by website owners.

*   **Web2 (roughly 2004-present):** The "read-write" web. Characterized by social media, user-generated content, and interactive applications. However, this era is dominated by centralized platforms that control user data and monetize it without adequately compensating users.

Web3, in contrast, aims to be a "read-write-own" web. This means users not only interact with content but also have ownership stakes in the platforms and services they use. This ownership is typically facilitated through tokens and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

> **EXPERT TIP:** Think of Web3 as building the internet on top of a shared, transparent, and secure database (the blockchain) instead of relying on centralized servers controlled by a few powerful companies.

**Key Characteristics of Web3:**

*   **Decentralization:** Power and control are distributed across a network, rather than concentrated in the hands of a few entities.
*   **Transparency:** Transactions and data are recorded on a public blockchain, making them auditable and verifiable.
*   **Immutability:** Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity.
*   **Permissionless:** Anyone can participate in the network without needing permission from a central authority.
*   **Native Payments:** Cryptocurrencies and tokens enable seamless and secure value transfer within the Web3 ecosystem.

## 2. Web3 vs Web2: A Paradigm Shift

The fundamental difference between Web2 and Web3 lies in data ownership and control. In Web2, companies like Google, Facebook (Meta), and Amazon collect and monetize user data, often without explicit consent or fair compensation. In Web3, users own their data and have the power to control how it's used.

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

| Feature          | Web2                                    | Web3                                       |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**   | Centralized servers                   | Decentralized networks (blockchain)        |
| **Data Ownership** | Companies own user data                | Users own their data                       |
| **Control**        | Centralized control by corporations      | Distributed control by network participants |
| **Transparency**   | Limited transparency                   | High transparency (on-chain)              |
| **Trust**          | Trust in intermediaries                 | Trustless (relies on cryptography)        |
| **Monetization**   | Companies monetize user data            | Users can monetize their data and creations |

**Did you know?** In 2024, data breaches cost companies an average of $4.45 million, highlighting the vulnerabilities of centralized data storage in Web2. Web3 aims to mitigate this risk through decentralized and secure data management.

## 3. Exploring the Landscape: Key Web3 Applications

**Step 2:** Create a new file named `HelloWorld.sol`.

**Step 3:** Paste the following Solidity code into the file:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HelloWorld {
    string public message;

    constructor(string memory _message) {
        message = _message;
    }

    function getMessage() public view returns (string) {
        return message;
    }

    function setMessage(string memory _newMessage) public {
        message = _newMessage;
    }
}
```

**Step 4:** Compile the contract by clicking on the Solidity compiler icon and then clicking "Compile HelloWorld.sol".

**Step 5:** Deploy the contract by clicking on the Deploy & Run Transactions icon.  Make sure you have a Web3 provider like MetaMask connected to Remix. Select "Injected Provider - MetaMask" from the Environment dropdown.

**Step 6:** Enter a message in the "message" field of the constructor and click "Deploy".  MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction.

**Step 7:** Once the transaction is confirmed, you can interact with the contract by calling the `getMessage()` and `setMessage()` functions.

This simple example demonstrates the basic workflow of Web3 development.  More complex applications require a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and smart contract security.
