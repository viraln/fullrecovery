## What is Programmable Matter?

Programmable matter refers to materials whose properties, such as shape, stiffness, conductivity, and color, can be altered dynamically and autonomously through external stimuli or internal programming.  Unlike traditional static materials, programmable matter can adapt and reconfigure itself to perform specific tasks or respond to changing environments.  This adaptability is achieved through various mechanisms, including embedded microprocessors, shape-memory alloys, and even self-assembly techniques.  Think of it as a material that "programs" itself to be something else entirely. ![Microscopic image of programmable matter components](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494192785370-e91e091d544f?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)
