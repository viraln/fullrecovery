## How Does Quantum Sensing Work?

Unlike classical sensors that rely on measuring macroscopic properties, quantum sensors leverage the bizarre and powerful principles of quantum mechanics. They utilize quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement to achieve unparalleled sensitivity and precision.  This means they can detect incredibly subtle changes in their environment, far beyond the capabilities of traditional sensors.

*   **Superposition:**  A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously.  This allows quantum sensors to simultaneously explore a wider range of possibilities, enhancing their measurement capabilities.
*   **Entanglement:**  Two or more quantum systems can become linked, sharing the same fate regardless of the distance separating them. This "spooky action at a distance" allows for incredibly precise measurements and enhanced stability.

> **EXPERT TIP:** Understanding the fundamental principles of superposition and entanglement is crucial to grasping the power of quantum sensing.
