## 1. Understanding the Core Concepts of Cognitive Concrete

Cognitive concrete, also known as smart concrete or self-sensing concrete, goes beyond traditional concrete by incorporating sensors, actuators, and data processing capabilities. These embedded systems allow the concrete to "sense" its internal and external environment, providing real-time data on stress, strain, temperature, humidity, and even the presence of cracks. This information is then used to assess the structural health of the concrete, predict potential failures, and trigger automated responses.
