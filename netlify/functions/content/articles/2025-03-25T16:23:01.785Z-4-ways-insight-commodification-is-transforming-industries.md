The traditional model of selling data analysis is shifting.  Instead of one-off projects, businesses are increasingly adopting the Insight-as-a-Service (IaaS) model.  This subscription-based approach provides ongoing access to tailored insights, dashboards, and predictive analytics. ![Graph showing growth of IaaS market](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1622782914767-404fb9ab3f57?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)

Insight commodification is driving a wave of hyper-personalization across various sectors.  By analyzing vast datasets, businesses can create highly targeted products, services, and marketing campaigns.  This level of personalization leads to improved customer engagement, higher conversion rates, and stronger customer loyalty. ![Example of personalized marketing campaign](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1642511283397-e0bc9d502762?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)

## 3.  The Emergence of Data Brokerages and Insight Aggregators

The increasing value of data insights has led to the rise of specialized data brokerages and insight aggregators. These companies collect, process, and resell aggregated and anonymized insights derived from various sources.  This creates a vibrant marketplace for data, making insights accessible to businesses that may lack the resources or expertise to collect and analyze data themselves. ![Diagram illustrating the data brokerage ecosystem](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543893794-d5badd72f7c2?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)
