Custom law zones, also known as custom legal jurisdictions or private legal systems, are defined areas where a unique set of laws and regulations apply, differing from the overarching national or international legal framework.

Think of them as bespoke legal environments designed to attract specific industries, activities, or communities.  The key is the *customization*: the laws are tailored to the specific needs and goals of the zone's stakeholders. ![A graphic illustrating the concept of a custom law zone within a larger jurisdiction.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1521587760476-6c12a4b040da?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)
