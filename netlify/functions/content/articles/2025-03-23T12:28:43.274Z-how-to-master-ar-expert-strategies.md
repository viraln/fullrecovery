## Understanding the Augmented Reality Landscape: AR vs. VR

Before diving into mastering AR, it's crucial to understand its distinction from virtual reality (VR). While both are immersive technologies, they differ significantly in their approach:

| Feature          | Augmented Reality (AR)                               | Virtual Reality (VR)                                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Environment** | Overlays digital content onto the real world           | Creates a completely immersive, simulated environment |
| **Interaction**  | Primarily through existing devices (phones, tablets)   | Requires specialized headsets and controllers           |
| **Application**  | Gaming, marketing, education, healthcare, manufacturing | Gaming, simulations, training, virtual tourism           |
| **Immersion**    | Partial immersion; user remains aware of their surroundings | Full immersion; user is disconnected from the real world |
