## What is Nano-Robotics?

Nano-robotics, also known as nanorobotics, is the emerging field of creating machines or robots whose components are at or near the nanometer scale (one billionth of a meter).  These incredibly tiny devices, often called nanobots or nanorobots, are designed to perform specific tasks at the molecular level.  Unlike their macroscopic counterparts, nanorobots leverage the unique properties of materials at the nanoscale, enabling unprecedented precision and capabilities. ![Microscopic image of a nanorobot prototype](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1603354350266-a8de3496163b?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)

> **DID YOU KNOW?** A single human hair is roughly 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide, giving you a sense of just how small these devices are!

## How Nanorobotics Work

The functioning of nanorobotics relies on a combination of advanced materials science, nanotechnology, and engineering principles.  Nanorobots are typically powered by various methods, including chemical reactions, magnetic fields, or even ultrasound.  Their movements and actions are controlled through external manipulation or internal programming.  The design and construction of these devices often involve sophisticated techniques like DNA origami, self-assembly, and microfabrication. ![Diagram illustrating the internal mechanisms of a nanorobot](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1605493624455-a56d6d312f6f?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)
