## The Evolution of Anime: From Humble Beginnings to Global Phenomenon

Anime's roots trace back to early 20th-century Japan, evolving from manga (Japanese comics) and influenced by Western animation techniques.  Post-World War II, Osamu Tezuka's innovative style, epitomized in *Astro Boy*, revolutionized animation, establishing many of the stylistic conventions we recognize today. ![Early anime artwork showcasing Osamu Tezuka's style](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519638399535-1b036603ac77?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)  The subsequent decades saw the rise of iconic studios like Studio Ghibli, known for masterpieces like *Spirited Away* and *My Neighbor Totoro*, solidifying anime's place in cinematic history.  The advent of the internet and streaming services propelled anime into the global spotlight, fostering a massive international fanbase.
