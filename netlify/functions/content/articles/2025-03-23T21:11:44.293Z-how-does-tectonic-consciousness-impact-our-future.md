Think of it as a "spiritual earthquake" – a powerful internal upheaval that leads to a more stable and evolved self. ![A stylized image depicting a person undergoing a transformation, perhaps with earth-toned colors and flowing lines](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1451187580459-43490279c0fa?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)
