## What is Moral Expansion? Understanding the Core Concept

**Moral expansion** refers to the process of widening the scope of individuals or entities to whom we extend moral consideration and concern. The **moral circle definition** encompasses those beings we consider worthy of ethical treatment, respect, and protection. Historically, this circle was often limited to immediate family or tribe. Over time, and with societal progress, it has expanded to include larger groups, such as nations, races, and genders. However, the potential for further expansion remains vast, encompassing animals, ecosystems, and even future generations. Understanding this evolution is crucial for fostering a more ethical and sustainable future.
