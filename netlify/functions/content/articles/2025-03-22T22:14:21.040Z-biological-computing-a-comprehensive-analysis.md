## What is Biological Computing?

Biological computing, simply put, leverages biological molecules and systems to perform computations. Unlike traditional computers that rely on transistors and electricity, biocomputers use biological components like DNA, RNA, proteins, and even entire cells to process information and solve problems.  This approach opens doors to tackling computational challenges that are intractable for conventional computers, particularly in areas requiring massive parallelism and complex pattern recognition.  ![Microscopic image of DNA strands](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1575468130766-fce03f7afaab?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)

> **Did you know?**  The concept of DNA computing was first proposed by Leonard Adleman in 1994, when he used DNA to solve a small instance of the Hamiltonian path problem.

## Types of Biological Computing

Several approaches fall under the umbrella of biological computing:
