## What is Morphological Computing?

Morphological computing harnesses the inherent computational power found in the shapes and structures of materials.  Unlike traditional computing, which relies on manipulating bits within silicon chips, morphological computing leverages the physical properties of materials to perform computations. Think of it as letting the material *itself* do the work, rather than relying on electronic signals.  This approach opens doors to entirely new types of computation, particularly well-suited for tasks requiring adaptation, resilience, and energy efficiency. ![Microscopic image of a material undergoing morphological computation](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484807352052-23338990c6c6?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)
