Many organizations are exploring hybrid models, combining remote work with a condensed on-site schedule.  The use of project management software and collaborative tools is also crucial for maintaining productivity and communication.  Furthermore,  a greater focus on employee well-being and mental health is driving the adoption of this innovative approach.

However, some companies may adjust compensation based on individual roles and responsibilities.  It's crucial to have transparent and open discussions about compensation when implementing a four-day workweek.
