## What is Science?  A Foundation for the Future

Understanding science's impact requires first defining what science actually *is*.  Science, at its core, is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  It's a process of observation, experimentation, and analysis, driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the world around us. This process, while rigorous, is constantly evolving, refining its understanding through new discoveries and technologies.  ![A diverse group of scientists working in a lab](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507413245164-6160d8298b31?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)

> **Did you know?** The scientific method, with its emphasis on observation and experimentation, has only been widely adopted in the last few centuries.  Before that, knowledge was often based on philosophical arguments or religious dogma.

## Science and Technology: A Symbiotic Relationship

Science and technology are deeply intertwined.  Science provides the fundamental knowledge, while technology provides the tools and techniques to apply that knowledge. This symbiotic relationship fuels innovation, driving progress across various sectors. For example, advancements in materials science (science) led to the development of stronger, lighter, and more durable materials used in everything from airplanes to smartphones (technology).  This constant feedback loop ensures that scientific breakthroughs translate into tangible improvements in our lives. ![A futuristic city showcasing advanced technology](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1532094349884-543bc11b234d?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)
