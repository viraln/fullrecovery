In 2025, data is the new oil, but insights are the refined fuel powering progress.  No longer a niche activity, the commodification of insights â€“ the process of transforming raw data analysis into sellable products and services â€“ has exploded. This isn't just about selling data; it's about packaging knowledge, expertise, and predictive power into valuable offerings for a hungry market. This article will explore why insight commodification is more crucial than ever and provide a comprehensive guide to navigating this evolving landscape.

However, raw data is meaningless without interpretation. This is where insight commodification steps in. Businesses are no longer satisfied with simply possessing data; they demand actionable insights that drive decision-making, optimize operations, and fuel innovation. This demand is creating a lucrative marketplace for those who can effectively package and sell their analytical expertise.

## Understanding the Different Forms of Insight Commodification
