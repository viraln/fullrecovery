## Low Code vs. No Code: Understanding the Differences

While often used interchangeably, low code and no code platforms cater to different user profiles and project complexities.

| Feature          | Low Code                               | No Code                                   |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Coding Required  | Minimal, for advanced customization     | None                                      |
| User Skill Level | Developers, citizen developers           | Business users, citizen developers          |
| Complexity       | High, suitable for complex applications | Moderate, best for simpler applications    |
| Customization   | Highly customizable                     | Limited customization                      |

Choosing between low code and no code depends on the project's scope, the team's technical skills, and the desired level of customization.
