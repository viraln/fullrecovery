## A Journey Through the History of Cyberdelic Culture

While the term "Cyberdelic" is relatively new, its roots lie in the convergence of several historical movements.  The psychedelic art movement of the 1960s, with its explorations of altered states of consciousness and vibrant visuals, forms a crucial foundation. The rise of computer graphics and digital art in the late 20th and early 21st centuries provided the technological tools to translate these psychedelic visions into a digital space.  The cyberpunk genre of science fiction, with its dystopian yet technologically advanced settings, also heavily influenced the aesthetic and thematic concerns of Cyberdelic.

The early 2020s saw the emergence of distinct online communities and artists who began experimenting with these combined elements.  By 2025, Cyberdelic has evolved into a recognizable and influential subculture.
