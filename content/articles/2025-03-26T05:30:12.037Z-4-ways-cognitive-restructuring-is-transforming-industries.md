This isn't about suppressing negative emotions; it's about understanding their origins and developing healthier coping mechanisms. ![A brain with highlighted neural pathways representing thought processes](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1604314035403-fb1d0e6635c4?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)
