## What Are Quantum Materials?

Quantum materials are substances that display properties arising directly from quantum mechanical phenomena. Unlike classical materials, their behavior can't be explained by traditional physics.  These properties often emerge at extremely low temperatures or under specific conditions, revealing extraordinary capabilities.  Examples include superconductivity (zero electrical resistance), topological insulation (conducting on the surface but insulating in the interior), and colossal magnetoresistance (dramatic changes in electrical resistance under magnetic fields). ![Microscopic image of a quantum material](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1742576033320-d6e7c5352192?q=85&w=1200&fit=max&fm=webp&auto=compress)
